# Retrospective Report – Seven Seas Spa Project

## Part 1: Review the User Story

The final output matched the original acceptance criteria for the “Detailed Services” page:
- All required services were included (Yoga, Wellness, Nutrition, Mental Health).
- Each service included an image, title, and short descriptive paragraph.
- Call-to-action links were added for user navigation.
- Page was tested for responsiveness and accessibility.

## Part 2: What Worked Well

- Copilot was used to scaffold the layout and generate semantic HTML efficiently.
- Bootstrap 5 components helped speed up responsive layout creation.
- AI-generated images aligned well with the wellness theme.
- Manual tweaks to spacing, font choices, and container sizes helped achieve a polished look.

## Part 3: Challenges & Solutions

- **Image Path Issues**: Some images didn’t load due to folder structure – fixed by checking relative paths and making sure images were inside `/assets/images/`.
- **Responsiveness Tweaks**: Minor layout breaks on mobile were solved by adjusting Bootstrap column classes.
- **AI Prompt Tuning**: Had to rewrite prompts more clearly to get usable HTML from Copilot.

## Part 4: Lessons Learned

- Incremental testing is essential when integrating AI-generated code.
- Clear prompts lead to better Copilot results.
- Manual CSS clean-up improves layout consistency across pages.
- GitHub Project Boards are great for tracking and prioritizing tasks.

## Part 5: Improvements for Next Time

- Spend more time organizing image assets before starting development.
- Create a custom CSS file earlier in the project for more control over styling.
- Try using a markdown-based documentation approach to log Copilot prompts and decisions.
